            <p class="texto"> Hello World! My name is Orlando Camacho Gámez, I'm 20 years old and I'm in my 6th semester of software engineering, I'm very interested in topics related to UI/UX interface design because I consider it to be one of the main things that make a desktop, web or mobile software feel pleasant and beyond the functionality they offer, users become familiar with it and are made to navigate through it in the most intuitive way.<br/><br/>

            My first line of code was like everyone else's, a simple hello world, however it is quite interesting because I wrote it when I was 12 years old, I have always been very interested in computing, but it was until my brother When I was older, I entered precisely this career that began to interest me too much in the world of software, in context I have 2 brothers, Alexander Camacho Gámez and Jesus Alfredo Camacho Gámez, both graduates of ITSON from the same career.<br/><br/>

            I have high expectations regarding this matter, because although mobile applications specifically for android are not what interests me the most, in fact I would like to specialize in the same branch but for iOS, I would hope to learn and lay the foundations on this branch of development. of the software and possibly apply them for iOS development.
