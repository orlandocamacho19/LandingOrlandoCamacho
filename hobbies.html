            <h1 class="titulo">My hobbies...</h1>
            <p class="texto"> Like any person in the world I have certain hobbies, which I would prefer to list below:<br><br>
                1.- Running<br>
                2.- Development<br>
                3.- Go to the movies<br>
                4.- Watch series<br>
                5.- Listen to music<br>
                6.- Videogames<br><br>

                I usually go running to the Náinari lagoon being a foreigner because it is very close to my apartment, I usually develop for pleasure because I improve my skills and learn even more, I usually go to the movies on Mondays, because it is extremely cheap and unlike the others who hate Mondays because it's the beginning of the week and it's about starting over with their jobs or classes, so that this doesn't happen to me and to start the week off right I go to the movies, which I like a lot I can't think of a favorite movie because I have like different seasons in which I change this one, currently it is Spiderman No Way Home, in my free time when I don't want to do any of the above or it's not Monday, without pending I watch some TV series, at this time I am watching Euphoria and Superman & Lois, I listen to a lot of music, to do homework or just to harmonize my space a bit and that there is some noise, usually they are ballads or quiet music, finally video games, I play a lot of fortnite and warzone, beyond vice, which is something that doesn't fascinate me, it takes up a lot of time, I enjoy it because I can play and talk with my foreign friends that I grew up with who are in different cities.
